    "### A. Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment provides the opportunity for you to practice with the capabilities of data wrangling in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. What to Hand In\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Sumbit a completed this Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. How to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your Jupyter notebook file through the course website in the Blackboard Learn system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. When to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your assignment no later than 11:59pm in the due date.\n",
    "2. There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Written Presentation Requirements (if applicable)\n",
    "Images must be clear and legible. Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness, and quality of writing, as well as their contents. Please make sure that the text of your assignments is well-structured, using paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of well-written presentation. Text font size should be either 11 or 12 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F. Marking Schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking assignments will be based on several aspects: presentation, correctness and coding styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "For programming questions, 10% of the mark will be judged on the coding style. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a set of guidelines for the coding style in this course:\n",
    "1. Write a good comment for each variable, each method, each control branch, and each loop.\n",
    "2. Use appropriate indentations to indicate control flows and blocks of code. \n",
    "3. Your method comments must mention the purpose of each parameter, and must be grammatically correct. \n",
    "4. Each line must be less than 80 characters long including tabs and spaces. \n",
    "5. Put a blank space before and after every operator. \n",
    "6. When breaking up a long line, break it before an operator, not after. \n",

    "### G. Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment needs the data sets specified in the questions.\n",

    "Download the dataset: `loan-applications.csv` and load it into a data frame. The data set contains several hundreds of loan application data. This data set provides a glimse of what bank and insurance companies facing during their data analyses. The goal is to automate the loan application process based on applicants' information. This data set contains many features of applicants, including: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. The main problem is that the data set contains missing values and different types of data. Here, you are asked to write code to clean and visualize the data and answer the following questions:\n",
    "- List the number of missing values for each column.\n",
    "- Remove the applications each of which has more than 2 missing values.\n",
    "- Forward fill up the missing values for columns with Object data type.\n",
    "- Fill up the missing values with their means for columns with numerical data types.\n",
    "- After the above steps, show that there are no missing data in the DataFrame.\n",
    "- Plot the relationship between Education and ApplicantIncome.\n",
    "- Plot the relationship between Property_Area and Loan_Status.\n",
    "- Categorize the ApplicantIncome into low (0-2000), medium (2000-20000), High(20000-50000), and Rich(>50000).\n",
    "- Plot the relationship between Loan_Status and the categories of ApplicantIncome.\n",
    "- Categorize the CoapplicantIncome into low (0-2000), medium (2000-10000), High(10000-20000), and Rich(>20000).\n",
    "- Plot the relationship between Loan_Status and the categories of CoapplicantIncome. \n",
    "- Develop plots to show the relationships between Load_Status and Education, Married, Credit_History. \n",
    "- For all the columns with no-numerical data (except for Loan_ID), convert the values to numerical categorical representations."
